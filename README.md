# GTK2 Documentation

This repository holds the last version of the official GTK2
documentation. Only the HTML files have been included here
and only the files found to be of interest for the
[Go-Curses] project.

These files are used by the `go-ctk` command's `gtk2doc`
feature which is intended to take these specific HTML files
and translate them into suitable Go-language boilerplate.
These boilerplate sources are then used as starting points
for implementing the corresponding feature within [CTK].

The GTK+ source archive and a copy of the GPL license is
included in this repo for convenience.
